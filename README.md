# OpenGL Cubes Demo

This project is a simple academic exercise to demonstrate an array of cubes in 3D space

The original idea comes from a demonstration by one of my instructors, Jay-Evan Tevis.

# Controls
- W/A/S/D - Move the camera in the four general directions.
- R/F - Move the camera Up/Down.
- x/y/z - Increase the cube array by one along the relevant axis (ie. 'x' extends the x axis)
- Shift + x/y/z - Decrease the cube array by one along the relevant axis (ie. 'X' reduces the x axis)
- c - Cycle through the 6 color options available.
- e - Toggle wireframe mode.
- Space - Reset the camera position.
- q - Quit the program.

# Credits / References
- C++ is the primary language used.
- The [freeglut](https://freeglut.sourceforge.net) library handles the basic OpenGL backend.
